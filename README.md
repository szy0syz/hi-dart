## lesson 14 Multi-line strings

> 直接连着单引号或者三个双引号!

```dart
void main() {
  print('This is a short sentence.\n'
       'This is a longer sentence, I dare say.\n'
       'This is even longer sentence, which will not fit inside a single line.'
  );
}
```

```dart
void main() {
  String s = """
This is a short sentence.
This is a longer sentence, I dare say.
This is even longer sentence, which will not fit inside a single line.
""";

  print(s);
}
```
